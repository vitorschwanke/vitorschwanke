- 👋 Hi, I’m @vitorschwanke
- 👀 I’m interested in data insights, sports and nature! I like to spend my time outside whenever is possible and always looking forward to learn new things and develop new skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis with python, ETL, SQL and noSQL databases and also visualization tools as PowerBI and Tableau. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different projects that can create a meaningful impact.
- 📫 How to reach me? vitorschwankev@gmail.com and https://www.linkedin.com/in/vitor-schwanke/ . 
- ⚡ Facts about me: Moved to Australia by myself at age 19. Did an exchange program in Germany at age 13. Now at age 25, I've just got a degree in Business Analytics, speak 4 languages and have traveled more than 25 countries.
